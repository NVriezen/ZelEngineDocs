The mission of this engine is to help intermediate developers realize there is more than only Object Oriented Programming.
The engine will loosely follow the data oriented design principles and let go of Object Oriented Design.
It does not mean you won't find any classes in the source code.
The focus is on the hardware and keeping the code simple.
